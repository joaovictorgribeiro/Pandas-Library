**Retail Sales Dataset**

The retail dataset consists of sales information from an online store operating nationwide, selling products from various departments. Additionally, the store operates across different sales channels, including marketplaces, its own store, among others.

**Business Assumptions:**

During the data analysis, some business assumptions were identified:

Purchases without State Information (UF - Unidade Federativa): Due to a system error, some purchases lack state information. To address this issue, these purchases were considered to be from the state of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS).

Final Product Price: The final price of a product cannot exceed the price including shipping.

**Metrics:**
**Top-selling Departments:** By analyzing sales data, we identified the most popular departments among customers. This information is useful for understanding which products are in high demand and for guiding the store's sales strategy.

**Average Price with Shipping by Department:** We calculated the average price with shipping by department to understand price behavior. This metric helps identify the most profitable departments and adjust product pricing accordingly.

**Sales per Month:** This metric allows us to identify seasonal buying patterns, which is useful for planning pricing and promotion actions to boost sales volume.

**Average Income by Sales Channel:** Identifying the average income for each sales channel helps determine the most profitable channels and enables targeted actions for these channels.

**Average Customer Age by 'Bandeira':** This metric helps understand customer profiles and allows adjustments to the product offering for each target audience.
